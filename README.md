# BiSABR: A Bi-Dimensional SABR Framework for Spread Option Pricing

## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository introduces a powerful extension of the classical SABR model to a **bi-dimensional stochastic volatility framework**, tailored to accurately price **spread options**. By accounting for both asset-specific volatilities and cross-correlationsâ€”including stochastic co-movementsâ€”this model provides **a closed-form approximation** of the spread option price, along with a practical calibration strategy.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features

- âœ… **Closed-form formula** for implied normal volatility in spread options.
- âœ… **Handles transverse correlations** (e.g., between volatilities and underlying cross-assets).
- âœ… **Efficient calibration** using market data from vanilla and spread options.
- âœ… **Monte Carlo benchmark validation** confirms pricing precision.
- âœ… Implemented using symbolic computation and can be ported to C++ or Python.

## ðŸ“Š Why It Matters for Traders

Spread options are commonly used in:

- Commodities (e.g. WTIâ€“Brent spreads),
- Energy (e.g. spark and crack spreads),
- Equities (e.g. dispersion and correlation trades),
- Fixed income (e.g. curve trades).

Yet, standard models like Black-Scholes or univariate SABR fail to accurately capture the **smile**, **skew**, and **vol of vol** seen in the spread option market.

**This model allows traders and quants to:**
- Capture **non-linear risks and convexity** in spread structures.
- Calibrate **hidden correlation structures** not visible in vanilla options.
- Perform **accurate pricing and hedging** without heavy simulation.
